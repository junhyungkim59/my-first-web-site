          <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
          <p>The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. <br>
            Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably.<br>
            However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. <br>
            So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.</p>
